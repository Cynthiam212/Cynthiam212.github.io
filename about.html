    <p>My Background</p>

    
    
    <p>
        My name is Cynthia I am Full stack software engineer. I am a 34 year old recent software engineer graduate. I have prior experience as a Chief operating officer to a recreational center I co-founded with two of my college friends for the south-eastern section of Queens. Our inspiration to create this was to address a pressing issue of our neighborhood; the youth did not have a local place to hang out and play basketball. As a result the young men in the neighborhood were hanging out the streets and getting into trouble. We created a safe place for them to do open gym without having to spend money to travel out of the community to a completely different neighborhood. From there we offered yoga, Zumba, and a fittnes bootcamp inwhich we broght in professional instructors. We also offered an intership program for highschool seniors to fulfil intership college credit. An afterschool program for ages 6 through 12. A computer class for beginners via the local church. We worked with local politician and 
        New York State Senator Leroy Comrie and Assembly Member Clyde Vanel.  And  I also have prior experience in the medical field as Certified Nursing assistant where I worked in a nursing home in Georgia attending to elderly assisted living patients with Dementia and other physcial medical conditions. Through that experience I learned effective communcation and active listening skills. The importance of effective teamworking and learning to balance off of eachother to ensure the safety of each patient, adaptability and time maanagement. 
        
        
        
        
        as well as a background in finance more specifically accountanting I was required to be extremely detailed oriented and oragainzed.
